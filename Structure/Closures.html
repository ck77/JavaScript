	// When call add function, counter + 1
	//Example Explained
	//The variable add is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function.
	//The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.
	//This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
	//This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
	//The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.
	//Note	A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
		var add = (function () {
			var counter = 0;
			return function () { return counter += 1; }
		})();

		function myFunction() {
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = add();
		}
